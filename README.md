# Welcome to My Portfolio

I decided to create my own portfolio from scratching using React to showcase and build upon my React skills, instead of using templates or a CMS. My portfolio website is a responsive application that contains information such as my contact information and information about me. Most importantly, it contains links to working websites and Github repos for projects that I have previously created. The goal of this project is to present my projects and skills to potential employers and fellow developers in a visually appealing and responsive UI. I plan on adding in backend and database features for form submission on the Contact page.
